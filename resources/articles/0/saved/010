The server comprises a couple of fairly easy PHP scripts that provide access to files and to the database.<\/p><h2>Structure<\/h2><p>There is just one single HTML page - <span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>index.html<\/span>. This calls in EasyCoder from its repository. When it runs it looks for an element whose id is <span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>ec-script<\/span>. This is assumed to be an EasyCoder script, which it compiles and runs.<\/p><p>The script in <span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>index.html<\/span> is a bootstrap which loads the main EasyCoder script for the website. Everything is done by this script, which in turn calls in other scripts as needed. No other Web pages are used at any time.<\/p><p>EasyCoder scripts are compiled immediately after they are loaded. This takes very little time - even the biggest scripts will compile in a few tens of milliseconds at most. Some scripts are kept in memory for as long as the website is being used; others are loaded and unloaded on demand. The amout of memory used by the EasyCoder system is small - typically only a few tens of megabytes.<\/p>"}

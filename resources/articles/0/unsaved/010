The server comprises a couple of fairly easy PHP scripts that provide access to files and to the database.<\/p><h2>Structure<\/h2><p>This is a &quot;single-page&quot; website; that is, there&#39;s just one single HTML page, <span style=~dq~color:#c0392b~dq~><span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>index.html<\/span><\/span>. When you navigate through the site, instead of new pages being constructed on the server and passed back complete, a program running in your browser requests the text and images it needs and updates the display itself. This is much faster as there&#39;s less data to transfer and you&#39;re not sharing the server with other users. <\/p><p>When the page starts it calls in EasyCoder from a central <a href=~dq~https:\/\/github.com\/easycoder\/normanton.life~dq~ target=~dq~_blank~dq~>repository<\/a>. When this runs it looks for an element with the id <span style=~dq~color:#c0392b~dq~><span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>easycoder-script<\/span><\/span>, whose content it compiles and runs.<\/p><p>The small script embedded in <span style=~dq~color:#c0392b~dq~><span style=~dq~font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace~dq~>index.html<\/span><\/span> is a bootstrap which loads the main EasyCoder script for the website. Everything is done by this script, which in turn calls in other scripts as needed. No other Web pages are used at any time.<\/p><p>EasyCoder scripts are compiled immediately after they are loaded. This takes very little time - even the biggest scripts will compile in a few tens of milliseconds at most. Some scripts are kept in memory for as long as the website is being used; others are loaded and unloaded on demand. The amount of memory used by the EasyCoder system is small - typically only a few tens of megabytes.<\/p>"}

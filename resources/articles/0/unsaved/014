You can submit text and photographs to us by email or add a new page yourself (but this is not an easy process for the inexperienced, so do get in touch with us first). If you would like to become a contributor or would like to contact us about any relevant matter, please email us at the following address:<\/p><p><a href=~dq~mailto:info@normanton.life~dq~>info@normanton.life<\/a><\/p><p>Articles are created here on this website. The process is similar in principle to that required to add a Facebook post, but there are additional complications. All content is moderated by one of our admins before it is released for public viewing. You will be able to see the articles you write, but until they are approved nobody else will be able to see them.<\/p><p>To ensure consistency, we require all content to fit a standard pattern. Articles come in two parts; a synopsis, which is what you see in the list of articles when you first visit the website. Each article has a title and preferably a banner image; the latter must have similar dimensions to those used by other articles. Either the title or the banner can be clicked\/tapped to go to the article itself. This can be formatted as you wish, but we discourage heavy text or unusual fonts as we prefer all articles to have the same overall feel. You are free to add as many photos and other images as you like (as long as they are not excessively huge) and there is no limit to the length of an article.<\/p><p>It should go without saying that we will not accept controversial, offensive or insulting content for publication. Our aim is to bring out the best. It may in some cases be possible to highlight problems as long as they are accompanied by solutions of a constructive nature.<\/p>"}
